TennisBooker is an automation pipeline that allows you to call a selenium script from your phone to automate booking tennis courts.

Once the command is sent from phone, the script automatically runs @ 12:00 AM the next day to book before everyone else!

This Project is a legacy version, checkout its successor [AutoBook](https://github.com/Abdulnaser97/AutoBook).
